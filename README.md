# Data-Engineering-Pipeline-with-Snowflake-and-dbt
Built an end-to-end ELT pipeline that ingests data with Airbyte, loads it into Snowflake, and transforms it with dbt to create clean staging views and fact tables for analysis. This project demonstrates modern data engineering practices for data integration and analytics.
